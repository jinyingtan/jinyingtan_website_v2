I am looking to add more features to this bot at a later time. \nThe difficulty I faced in the process of building the bot is in retriving of the actual news data. The economic news data was categorized into 2 data groups, one was the title of the news, forecast and previous price data that was readily available on the site for use and the second group was the actual data that was not readily available. I had to use the chrome inspector to find where the data was retrieve and also how was the actual data retrieved",
